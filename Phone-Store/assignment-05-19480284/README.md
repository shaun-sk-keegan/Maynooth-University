# Phone Store back-end
In this assignment I used CRUD functionality with a NodeJS application implementing said functionality
- The 'connect' javascript program is used in order to connnect the database to the server
- The 'crud' javascript program contains all functionality that can be used to manipulate the database
- The program starts by connecting the database to the server and then implements crud functionality
- All CRUD functionality in this program is initially commented, uncomment any code piece to see it's functionality in action
